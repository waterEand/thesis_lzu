# Outliers Removal Based on Sparse-Graph Codes

HOLA

This is my Bachelor's thesis in Mathematics, written at Lanzhou University in 2024. This repository contains the LaTeX source code, Python implementation, and presentation slides for the oral defense of my work.

Advised by Prof. Peng Li, I proposed a novel outlier removal method integrated with a support recovery algorithm to reconstruct sparse signals corrupted by outliers.

üèÖ This thesis was recognized with the *Excellent Undergraduate Thesis Award* at Lanzhou University.
