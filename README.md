# Outliers Removal Based on Sparse-Graph Codes

Hi guys!

This is my Bachelor's thesis in mathmatics, written at Lanzhou University in 2024. This respository contains LaTeX source code and python code of my thesis.

You can see name of my work: (exactly the title)

Advised by Dr. Peng Li, I proposed a new outliers removal method associated with an existing support recovery alg to recover sparse signals with outliers.
