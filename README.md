# Outliers Removal Based on Sparse-Graph Codes

HOLA

This is my Bachelor's thesis in mathmatics, written at Lanzhou University in 2024. This respository contains LaTeX source code, python code and slides for oral defense of my work.

Advised by *Prof. Li*, I proposed a **new outliers removal method** associated with an existing support recovery alg to recover sparse signals with outliers.
